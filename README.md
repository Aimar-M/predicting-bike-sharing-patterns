# predicting-bike-sharing-patterns
This is my first deep neural network built from scratch as part of the Udacity deep learning Nanodegree.


The goal of this project is to use a neural network to help a fictional bike sharing company to estimate the number of bikes they need from historical data. Too many bikes result in money lost on bikes sitting around and too few result in money lost from potential riders.



* this project uses python 3
* Open the jupyter notebook named Your_first_neural_network.ipynb to see the project complete project
* The dataset is in the Bike-sharing-dataset
* check my_answers.py to see the code of the neural network and the hyperparameters I use

## to effectively run the jupyter notebook u will need 
* import numpy, pandas and matplotlib
